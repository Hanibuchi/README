# README

## Hi there, I'm Hanibuchi!

I'm a university student from Japan who is passionate about making games, especially 2D action games.  
I love working with Unity, and I'm currently developing a game inspired by *Noita*, *Hollow Knight*, *Rain World*, *Animal Well* and more — I’m drawn to deep, atmospheric worlds with emergent gameplay and creative mechanics.

### What I do:
- Game development in Unity (C#)
- Programming in Python and C#
- Learning full-stack skills to become a project manager in the future
- Recently studying software design patterns to improve code architecture
- Took Japan’s Applied Information Technology Engineer Examination (AP) — likely passed!

### What I value:
- Creating games that bring joy and wonder
- Writing clean, maintainable code
- Always learning and growing as a developer

### Fun facts:
- I have a sweet tooth and a slim build
- I'm on a journey to improve my communication skills
- I dream of publishing a game on Steam someday

Thanks for stopping by! Feel free to check out my projects and connect with me.
